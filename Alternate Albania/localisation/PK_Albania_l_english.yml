### Events ###
albania.1.t:0 "The Albanian Principality"
albania.1.d:0 "During the First Balkan War of 1912, the Albanian National Congress in Vlorë declared the country's independence which was accepted by the major powers in 1913, upon the condition that Wilhelm of Wied would be rule as Prince of the new nation. The outbreak of the Weltkrieg brought upon new problems for Albania as Austria-Hungary demanded that Albanian soldiers were to fight alongside them in the war. When Prince Wilhelm refused, citing the neutrality of Albania due to the Treaty of London, the remuneration that he had been receiving was very suddenly cut off. His regime collapsed and Prince Wilhelm left the country on September 3, 1914 and joined the Imperial German Army, despite formally remaining the Albanian Head Of State. In 1921, the Peace with Honour officially determined the status of Albania; a restored principality under the authority of the Prince Wilhelm, no longer under Austrian influence, but as a formal vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Despite continuous revolts, Prince Wilhelm was able to regain control of the country thanks to Ottoman support. However, the price he had to pay was the Ottoman control over the country's inner politics, such as forcing the Prince to appoint the very ambitious, and scheming, Ahmed Zogu as his Prime Minister."
albania.1.a:0 "Rule Albania!"

albania.2.t:0 "Fate of Albania"
albania.2.d:0 "For many years, the Ottomans have ruled over us in an uneasy agreement with Germany to have Wilhelm on the throne. Today, problems have arisen for the Ottomans, and Zog wishes to claim the throne once and for all and establish a Free Albania."
albania.2.a:0 "Overthrow Wilhelm and set Zog as ruler of all of the Albanians!"
albania.2.b:0 "Nonsense! Wilhelm is loved by the people!"
albania.2.c:0 "We don't need a king! The National Front rebels!"
albania.2.e:0 "We don't need a king! Bring democracy to Albania!"

albania.3.t:0 "Wilhelm of Albania overthrown!"
albania.3.d:0 "For many years, we have ruled over Albania in an uneasy agreement with Germany to have Wilhelm on the throne. Today, [ALB.GetLeader] has overthrown Wilhelm in a coup. How should we react to this mess?"
albania.3.a:0 "Recognise [ALB.GetLeader] as the new ruler, let Albania go"
albania.3.b:0 "Blasphemy! Crush this upstart!"

albania.4.t:0 "Albanian uprising successful!"
albania.4.d:0 "The Albanian forces led by [ALB.GetLeader], have assumed full control of Albania. Our garrisons have been taken prisoner, and some of our generals warn that trying to recapture our former vilayet would result in much bloodshed for little gain. Shall we recognise the independence of Albania?"
albania.4.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
albania.4.b:0 "Never!"

albania.5.t:0 "The Albanian Campaign is Over"
albania.5.d:0 "After the Albanians began to resist our benevolent rule, we began a campaign to put them back in their place. Now, Albania is in our hands once again."

albania.6.t:0 "The Ottomans have been defeated!"
albania.6.d:0 "Glorious day! We have soundly defeated the Ottoman garrison, and imprisoned their valuable soldiers and generals. Since the Ottoman control over Albania is over, [ALB.GetLeader] should focus on uniting this somewhat divided country."
albania.6.a:0 "Liri e Shqiperise! Freedom for Albania!"

albania.7.t:0 "Albania leaves our sphere of influence"
albania.7.d:0 "Following our disastrous defeat, Prince Wilhelm zu Wied of Albania proclaimed independnence from our state. As they're decently distanced from our country, it would be a pain to have another, unprofitable campaign for our tired soldiers."

albania.8.t:0 "Albania in Mitteleuropa?"
albania.8.d:0 "Following the Ottoman Empire's disastrous defeat, Prince Wilhelm zu Wied of Albania proclaimed full independnence from their rule.

albania.12.a:0 "It must be the newspapers."
albania.12.b:0 "Try to put a stop on it."

albania.14.t:0 "The Xoxe-Hoxha split"
albania.14.d:0 "Today, in our nation's cabinet, two prominent socialist politicians - Enver Hoxha and Koçi Xoxe, have voiced their stern disagreements over several topics. Although this doesn't hurt our current party, it has still made a split in the Albanian socialist politics."
albania.14.a:0 "Troubling."

albania.15.t:0 "Hold Elections?"
albania.15.d:0 "Since our situation is beginning to stabilize, it would be a good time to start holding elections. Fan Noli has been this country's leader through awful times, and, although this democracy is somewhat flawed, has expressed his desire to start elections. What can we do?"
albania.15.a:0 "We're not ready for such undertakings."

albania.16.t:0 "Albania offers peace"
albania.16.d:0 "Today, the Albanian diplomat announced that the Albanian government is ready to cooperate with us, although they have decided that they won't join the Belgrade pact. Instead, they have decided on quietly isolating themselves from all the chaos that's happening, and have asked us to sign a non-aggression pact with them. We can refuse, but in most cases it would be futile. What should we do?"
albania.16.a:0 "No point in being hostile to them."
albania.16.b:0 "We won't sign for... reasons."

albania.17.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepts"

albania.19.t:0 "Albania asks for a guarantee"
albania.19.d:0 "Today, the Albanian diplomat has kindly asked us to guarantee their country's independence, for the sake of stability in the region. They will fall into our sphere of influence, however, we will be dragged into any war they have. What should we do?"
albania.19.a:0 "It would be for the best."
albania.19.b:0 "We won't waste our time!"

albania.20.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepts"
albania.20.d:0 "We have received news from the Albanian delegate in [From.GetName]. The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced their full support in assuring our country's independence!"

albania.21.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] refuses"
albania.21.d:0 "We have received news from the Albanian delegate in [From.GetName]. The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced their refusal of guaranteeing our independence. Perhaps they can't be bothered protecting such a small country."
albania.21.a:0 "We can do it ourselves."

albania.22.t:0 "Albania in the [Root.GetFactionName]?"
albania.22.d:0 "Today, the Albanian diplomat has asked us for the state of [Root.GetFactionName]. Afterwards, they have expressed their wish in joining the [Root.GetFactionName]. We can either accept them, or rightfully refuse. What should we do?"
albania.22.a:0 "Welcome, Albanian brothers!"
albania.22.b:0 "Albanians don't belong in the [Root.GetFactionName]."

albania.23.t:0 "The [From.GetFactionName] accepts us!"

albania.24.a:0 "We can manage on our own."

albania.25.t:0 "The Albanian Screwup"
albania.25.d:0 "After accepting the invitation to the Austrian Sphere, the Albanian government has realized... they're still technically in the Belgrade Pact. Following this screwup, the Albanian government wonders what to do. (This event is made because of the AI's willingness to accept invitations to the Austrian sphere.)"
albania.25.a:0 "That was a dumb mistake."
albania.25.b:0 "Screw the pact!"

albania.26.t:0 "The Albanian Screwup"
albania.26.d:0 "After accepting the invitation to the Austrian Sphere, the Albanian government has realized... they're still technically in the 3rd International. Following this screwup, the Albanian government wonders what to do. (This event is made because of the AI's willingness to accept invitations to the Austrian sphere.)"
albania.26.a:0 "That was a dumb mistake."
albania.26.b:0 "This is inter-ideological love."

albania.27.t:0 "Plesbiscite in Kosovo"
albania.27.d:0 "This day was marked by huge unrest in the Kosovo region. Albanian citizens have been protesting our rule, and have effectively voted to be annexed by Albania. This has, of course, caused us political instability and unrest in the region. We can either allow them to secede, or we can rightfully refuse. What should we do?"
albania.27.a:0 "We're better off without them."
albania.27.b:0 "Kosovo is the heart of Serbia!"

albania.28.t:0 "Kosovo Plebiscite fails"
albania.28.d:0 "Our covert agents have received reports that the Kosovo plebiscite failed. The Albanians in Kosovo are blissfully unaware of the dangers, which will likely result in them getting trouble with the extremist, Serbian authorities. However, we can still declare war on Serbia, although without the support of the Kosovo Albanians. What can we do?"
albania.28.a:0 "They're the instrument of their own doom."
albania.28.b:0 "Step in and save the Albanian people!"

albania.29.t:0 "Serbia lets Kosovo go"
albania.29.d:0 "Today, the Serbian government has announced that they've let Kosovo go. The people of Kosovo have joined our country, being offered protection and a stable life. This is a huge success for us."
albania.29.a:0 "Welcome, brothers."

albania.30.t:0 "Serbia keeps Kosovo"
albania.30.d:0 "Despite the Plebiscite succeeding, the Serbian government has decided to keep Kosovo in their own hands, and endanger the Albanian people even further. We will not tolerate their hostile actions towards the Albanian people!"
albania.30.a:0 "To war, my brothers!"
albania.30.b:0 "Later..."

albania.31.t:0 "Our attack on Kosovo"
albania.31.d:0 "The day has come, when we plan a takeover of Kosovo and reuining our Albanian brothers from the other side of the border. However, there are several ways to do this. The first way would be to arm their population and encourage radical views, essentially creating an uproar before we step in. The other way would be us not wasting any rifles or infantry equipment, and instead just outright invading Kosovo. We can still delay this attack."
albania.31.a:0 "Try to radicalize the Kosovo Albanians."
albania.31.b:0 "Retake Kosovo now!"
albania.31.c:0 "Leave it for later."

albania.32.t:0 "Radicalization Successful"
albania.32.d:0 "Our agents have successfully supplied the Kosovo Albanians with weapons and radical thought. We can now commence our takeover with our newfound allies!"

albania.33.t:0 "Radicalization Unsuccessful"
albania.33.d:0 "Our agents have reported that they've failed to supply the Kosovo Albanians with weapons, and radical philosophies were rejected by them. We have lost a potential ally. How can we approach this situation?"
albania.33.a:0 "Doesn't matter, declare war!"
albania.33.b:0 "We weren't prepared for this."

albania.34.t:0 "Our further claims in Greece"
albania.34.d:0 "In the light of our recent battles, we can still enforce some of our... stretched claims, and take land away from Greece. One, smaller option would be Corfu and the rest of the Ionian islands, which would make a perfect naval base. The other option is claiming both Corfu and Epirus, which would be easier if we're ruled by a king. And lastly, we can just leave these claims alone, and be content with what we have."
albania.34.a:0 "We will rule over Corfu!"
albania.34.b:0 "Corfu and Epirus will be ours!"
albania.34.c:0 "Leave them alone."
