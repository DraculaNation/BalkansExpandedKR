### Description ###
ILL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Weltkrieg, the Austrians have successfully acquired Montenegro and put Serbia under supervision. However, a series of pan-slavic rebellions soon shook the Southern Slavic lands under the Austrian crown, being particularly intense in areas like Zagreb and Podgorica. Coupled with the Croatians being unhappy under the Hungarian crown, the Habsburgs have carved out a pan-slavic state, largely based on the Illyrian movement, as a federated member of the Habsburg Monarchy, and put a local noble, Stjepan Sarkotić von Lovćen as the representative of Kaiser Karlo IV. Only time will tell if Illyria would be a successful country."

ILL_croatian_command:0 "Croatian Officers"
ILL_croatian_command_desc:0 "The Croatian people fought to make an Illyria free of Austria a reality, while the rest of the so called Illyrians hid in their cities and did nothing. It is for this reason that we must restrict all officer position to Croatians at the cost of alienating the rest of our countrymen."
ILL_federated_army:0 "United Officer Corp"
ILL_federated_army_desc:0 "Despite all odds, we have managed to win against all who sought to destroy our fledgling nation, but there is much still left to do. All the military officers of Illyria, no matter which country they're from, must be pooled into a single and united Illyrian Officer Corp."
ILL_regional_command_idea:0 "Regional Command"
ILL_regional_command_idea_desc:0 "Due to the state of our country, we have decided that it would be best to let local regions take care of their armies. Therefore, we can focus our valuable time on other things instead of bothering ourselves with the army."

ILL_economic_dependency_idea:0 "Economic Dependency"
ILL_economic_dependency_idea_desc:0 "Being a satelite state of Austria, Illyria is pretty much dependent on the superior Austrian economy. While this greatly helps the Illyrian economy, it also means that Illyria is less dependent."
ILL_austrian_education_idea:0 "Austrian Education"
ILL_austrian_education_idea_desc:0 "Illyria has succeeded in implementing the Austrian education system in their country. While this gives their people a better chance at life, it also means that they're even more dependent on Austria."

ILL_slovenian_nationalist_revival_idea_desc:0 "Something has angered the Slovenians..."
ILL_economic_independency1_idea:0 "Recent Economic Independency"

ILL_croat_focused_idea:0 "Croatian-centered Politics"
ILL_croat_focused_idea_desc:0 "The Croatian-centered politics of Illyria aim to please the Croatians, who constitute the majority of Illyrians. This helps to satisfy the vocal Croatian patriots, who previously opposed the idea of Illyria."

ILL_bosnian_investments_idea:0 "Bosnian Investments"
ILL_bosnian_investments_idea_desc:0 "The Illyrian government has been heavily investing in industrializing Bosnia.

ILL_rural_exploitation_idea:0 "Rural Exploitation"

ILL_greater_croatia_minority_idea_desc:0 "The nation of greater Croatia is considered impure by the Ustaše, as there are still areas inhabited by various minorities. These minorities are causing significant unrest and further destabilization."

ILL_spaho_croatian_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "Ever since the Ustaše lost the civil war, Croatian nationalists are still bitter about the civil war, knowing that Spaho will not go easy on them. Thus, they're creating unrest in our all-Illyrian country."

ILL_illyrian_illyria_idea_desc:0 "Many have fought to destroy our nation, some out of fear, some out of spite. However, we have emerged victorious from all of the conflicts that threatened us, and we stand victorious over the ashes of our enemies. Glory to Illyria!"
ILL_catholics_favored_idea:0 "Catholic State"
ILL_catholics_favored_idea_desc:0 "With us being a Catholic state, it goes without saying that we favor the Catholics over any other religion. With Catholicism being an integral part of the Croatian identity, we're also stronger in terms of patriotism and nationalism."

ILL_historical_revisionism_desc:0 "With our huge ideological victory, we need to revise our education system, as well as present some... alternative facts about our country.

ILL_god_protects_us_desc:0 "With our dream of a strong, Catholic croatia being realized, we can only thank the Lord for guiding our people against everyone that has sought to destroy us. It is time for us to embrace the Lord even more, and enjoy the fruits of our success."

### Events ###
illyria.1.t:0 "Kingdom of Illyria"
illyria.1.d:0 "The Triune Kingdom of Illyria, which consists of the former Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Kingdom of Dalmatia and Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina was proclaimed after the Crisis in Austro-Hungary and German Intervention in 1922. The creation of Illyria was proposed by the loyal to Vienna Croatian aristocrats and officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, who promised to be loyal to the Kaiser Karl and Austria, but claimed more autonomy and the end of the Hungarian rule on the lands of the South Slavs. Though the Triune Kingdom should have become a home for the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks, in fact there are a lot of controversies between these nations. The Serbs want to reunite with their Serbian Motherland, the Montenegrins want to be free from the Austrian grip, the Bosniaks want to get more independence due to them being economically neglected, and some of the Croats, who have a relative majority in the country, want to strengthen their position in the country and reorganise it into Great Croatia. As of now, things barely hang in balance, stabilized by Austria, but Stjepan Sarkotić's old age is proving to be problematic, and with his death, Illyria may escape the Austrian grip."
illyria.1.a:0 "Our Beautiful Homeland!"

illyria.2.t:0 "Matica Ilirska"
illyria.2.d:0 "'Matica Ilirska' ('Parent body of the Illyrians') is the oldest educational organisation in Illyria, which started its activity as a book publishing company in 1842. The main aim of 'Matica' is the promotion of the Illyrian culture and language and also support to the mutual understanding between the nations of Illyria. With help of the 'Matica ilirska' the leaders of Illyria try to form a well-educated and an united Illyrian nation. Now one of the most important missions of the organisation is the codification of the Illyrian language standard. Though it has been a hard work, but it seems that the most famous Illyrian writers and linguists have finally negotiated, which rules of the language our young generation will learn at schools. The creation of the united Illyrian nation is closer now!"
illyria.2.a:0 "Wistful is my Slavic soul, I'm Illyrian!"

illyria.3.t:0 "Status of Montenegro"
illyria.3.d:0 "Montenegro was a small, but independent kingdom, which even the Ottoman Empire couldn't annex. But it was occupied in 1916 by the forces of Austro-Hungary and was incorporated into Illyria in 1922. But even now the Orthodox Montenegrins have a large autonomy in our state and accepted only these orders from Zagreb, which can't affect the life of this distant part of our country. More over, many of the local citizens are friendly to Serbia - our main enemy on the Balkans. We should keep it in mind, since any violation of the Montenegrin rights can provoke a crisis between Illyria and Serbia and even lead to a new Balkan war."
illyria.3.a:0 "Don't count on them."

illyria.4.t:0 "Sarajevo Agreement"
illyria.4.d:0 "The nations of our Triune Kingdom use one South Slavic language, but the Croat, Serbian and Bosnian versions of it have some differences. More over, the Serbs use the Cyrillic script, while the Croats and Bosniaks prefer the Latin script. 'Matica Ilirska' has already established the united standards of the language, which will be used in our Kingdom, but we still don't know, how to name our language. We can name it 'Croatian' and use the Latin script, since the Croats constitute the majority in our country with 60% of the population. Another possible name is the 'Serbo-Croatian' with both Cyrillic and Latin scripts to represent the role of the Serbs, who are the main minority in Illyria with 30% of our citizens. Or we can name the language 'Illyrian' to encourage the unification of our people and use the Latin script, with Croatian, Serbian and other languages being considered dialects. However, this would be just a claim, which would be seen as somewhat crazy."
illyria.4.a:0 "The Croat language is the only one in Illyria!"
illyria.4.b:0 "Long live Brotherhood and Unity - the Serbo-Croatian!"
illyria.4.c:0 "We are the Illyrians - and we speak Illyrian!"

illyria.5.t:0 "Highway 'Unity'"
illyria.5.d:0 "The construction of the highway 'Unity' was proposed by our prime minister in order to connect the biggest cities of the Illyria - Zagreb, Sarajevo and Podgorica. With the Austrian subsidies we will be able to hire enough workers and complete the construction soon. This project will also help us to reduce the unemployment rate in many our regions and revive the construction market in the Kingdom."
illyria.5.a:0 "We worked, we work and we will work even more!"

illyria.6.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić's retirement"
illyria.6.d:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić, the faithful king of Illyria, is nearing his death by each passing day. In order for his death not to cause any chaos, we must retire him, and replace him with someone else. The situation is better than we anticipated, as Illyria was making Austrian-friendly reforms which allows us to directly put one of the Habsburgs as the head of Illyria, since Sarkotić himself doesn't have any descendants. Karl I Von Habsburg would be the rightful choice, however, his son Otto I has shown interest in Illyrian culture, and it would please both us and the Illyrians if we put him as the Illyrian king."
illyria.6.a:0 "Karl I is the new King of Illyria!"
illyria.6.b:0 "Let them be lead by someone who appreciates them."

illyria.7.t:0 "Illyria recognizes our governance"
illyria.7.d:0 "Today, king Stjepan Sarkotić recognized our governance over the Kingdom of Illyria. Needless to say, this helps us quench Illyrian separatism for a bit, and how things are going, it doesn't seem that Illyria will secede any time soon."
illyria.7.a:0 "Cheers to the people of Illyria!"

illyria.8.t:0 "Illyrians take our side"
illyria.8.d:0 "Today, king Stjepan Sarkotić of Illyria reassured the Illyrian people that the Hungarians are our common enemies. This further stabilized the relations between our kingdoms."
illyria.8.a:0 "Glory to the Illyrian-Austrian brotherhood!"

illyria.9.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić dies"
illyria.9.d:0 "Today, it was announced that Stjepan Sarkotić died from natural causes. As it was time for him to pass away because of his old age, Stjepan Radić took the power of representing Karl I in this country. However, the Illyrian populace conspires that he will try to wrestle the control of Illyria from the Habsburgs, as he had troubles with Austrian authority before."
illyria.9.a:0 "Good luck Mr. Radić!"

illyria.10.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić dies"
illyria.10.d:0 "Today, it was announced that Stjepan Sarkotić died from natural causes. As it was time for him to pass away because of his old age, Stjepan Radić took the power of representing Karl I in Illyria. However, we know that he won't do a perfect job, and will likely advocate for more autonomy in Illyria. We can't take any actions since the empire is already in chaos."
illyria.10.a:0 "Damn you Mr. Radić!"

illyria.11.t:0 "Illyria requests more autonomy"
illyria.11.d:0 "Stjepan Radić, the thorn in our side for quite a while, has requested us to give Illyria more autonomy in the behalf of the Illyrian people who, after Radić's victory, are becoming increasingly anti-Austrian. Declining their request would lead to more unrest in Illyria, but will also help us keep control over them, for now. What can we do?"
illyria.11.a:0 "They'll still be under our crown."
illyria.11.b:0 "We cannot let this happen."

illyria.12.t:0 "Illyria lets Montenegro go"
illyria.12.d:0 "We have received news that Stjepan Radić has granted independence to Montenegro. Despite this being a breach in our constitution as we weren't involved, it was probably because Montenegro proved difficult to control, and the Montenegrins sabotaged them more than they helped. Nevertheless, this is still an unhonorable move from them."
illyria.12.a:0 "It's a travesty, I tell you!"

illyria.13.t:0 "Illyria demands Slovenia"
illyria.13.d:0 "Today, Stjepan Radić has made a public appeal for us to cede Slovenia to them. However, the appeal was far from honorable, and included several themes of Slovenian nationalism. As we cannot let go of the Slovenians, who have been decently assimilated into the Austrian society, our only option is to refuse their offer."
illyria.13.a:0 "It's a travesty, I tell you!"

illyria.14.t:0 "Illyria asks for our help"
illyria.14.d:0 "A nation by the name of Illyria, which claims to be a union of all the South Slavs, is asking us to support their independence from Austria-Hungary. If we want to overthrow the Austrians as the rulers of the Balkans, we should support Illyria's independence."
illyria.14.a:0 "They have our support!"
illyria.14.b:0 "We have no interest."

illyria.15.t:0 "Illyria asks for our help"
illyria.15.d:0 "A nation by the name of Illyria, which claims to be a union of all the South Slavs, is asking us to support their independence from Austria-Hungary. We have little interest in Western Balkan as a region, however, accepting their independence will no doubt hinder Austria."
illyria.15.a:0 "They have our support!"
illyria.15.b:0 "We have no interest."

illyria.16.t:0 "Illyria asks for our help"
illyria.16.d:0 "A nation by the name of Illyria, which claims to be a union of all the South Slavs, is asking us to support their independence from Austria-Hungary. As the Austrians are our friends, supporting the Illyrian independence would be diplomatic suicide. We shouldn't support them unless we wish to end the Austro-Hungarian hegemony."
illyria.16.a:0 "They have our support!"
illyria.16.b:0 "We're no backstabbers."

illyria.17.t:0 "Illyria asks for our help"
illyria.17.d:0 "A nation by the name of Illyria, which claims to be a union of all the South Slavs, is asking us to support their independence from Austria-Hungary. We have little interest in Western Balkan as a region, however, accepting their independence will no doubt hinder Austria."
illyria.17.a:0 "They have our support!"
illyria.17.b:0 "We have no interest."

illyria.18.t:0 "Illyria seeks independence"
illyria.18.d:0 "Recently, we have received reports that our neighbours to the west, the Illyrians, have sent several diplomatic messages to some major countries asking to support their independence. We can chime in and announce our support for their independenct in order to destabilize Austria."
illyria.18.a:0 "Announce our support!"
illyria.18.b:0 "We'll be honorable."

illyria.19.t:0 "International Support"
illyria.19.d:0 "Sadly, we haven't received much support from the rest of the world, and thus, our effort to achieve independence is rendered moot. We have slipped back into the Austrian sphere of influence, again."
illyria.19.a:0 "Oh bother..."

illyria.20.t:0 "International Support"
illyria.20.d:0 "We have successfully achieved enough international support for us to be taken seriously by the Habsburgs. We can proceed towards achieving independence, unhindered."
illyria.20.a:0 "The people of Illyria are grateful."

illyria.21.t:0 "Organizing a Plebiscite"
illyria.21.d:0 "To make this step in achieving our independence, we'll need to organize a plebiscite across our lands. We already know that there is a huge chance for this plebiscite to succeed, but however, we can also organize one in Slovenia, which will increase the risk we take, but it will benefit us to have Slovenia under our rule. How much of a risk are we willing to take?"
illyria.21.a:0 "Play it safe."
illyria.21.b:0 "Push for Slovenia!"

illyria.22.t:0 "The Plebiscite Succeeds"
illyria.22.d:0 "The Plebiscite's results came back in, and it's shown that most people want us to secede from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. It is nice to know that our people support us!"
illyria.22.a:0 "God bless every Illyrian!"

illyria.23.t:0 "Slovenians not allowed to secede"
illyria.23.d:0 "As the plebiscite was also conducted in rightful Slovenian lands, where the Austrians rule, it was up to the Austrians to either allow the Slovenians to secede, or to punish them. Looks like they've chosen the latter, as we've also received a warning from Austria itself."
illyria.23.a:0 "We'll get them sooner or later..."

illyria.24.t:0 "The Plebiscite Fails"
illyria.24.d:0 "The Plebiscite's results came back in, and it's shown that more than half people want us to stay under the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. It is sad to know that our people, the Illyrians themselves, lack the trust in their country."
illyria.24.a:0 "We have to obey the people."

illyria.25.t:0 "Slovenians want to secede"
illyria.25.d:0 "While making a plebiscite for their own people, the Illyrian government also decided to enact one such plebiscite in Slovenia, where people could vote to secede from our country and join Illyria, who seems to be on a path to independence. We can stop them and let their nationalists preach against us, or we can let them go."
illyria.25.a:0 "Let them go"
illyria.25.b:0 "This is a travesty!"

illyria.26.t:0 "Illyria wants to cut ties with us"
illyria.26.d:0 "Illyria, a country that holds our rightful territory, is in the process of achieving independence from Austria. One of their plans is to also cut their... not so pleasant ties with us, asking us to renounce our claims on their lands. If we do so, we'll lose our chance of gaining a port to the Adriatic. There is still an option of declining, but we can use this to make a compromise and come to mutual agreement, in order to spite Austria."
illyria.26.a:0 "Ask them to cede Syrmia and send reparations."
illyria.26.b:0 "We'll never renounce our claims!"

illyria.27.t:0 "Hungary wants a compromise"
illyria.27.d:0 "While cutting ties with the Hungarians, it was clear that it wouldn't be without compromises. In order for them to renounce their claims on us, we have to cede the Serbian-majority area of Syrmia, and on top of that, send them financial reparations. That way, they assert full control over Serbian-majority areas north of Belgrade, and we get rid of the potentially rebellious Serbian minority. If we refuse, they wouldn't renounce their claims, even if it will only minimally hinder our quest for independence."
illyria.27.a:0 "Fulfill their demands."
illyria.27.b:0 "This is ridiculous."

illyria.28.t:0 "Hungary refuses to renounce their claims"
illyria.28.d:0 "Even though this step isn't completely essential for us to achieve independence, successfully completing it would certainly help us in the long run. However, the Hungarian government refused to renounce their claims. It's just a minor hindrance, but a hindrance nonetheless."
illyria.28.a:0 "Their loss."

illyria.29.t:0 "Illyria caves in"
illyria.29.d:0 "The Illyrians have agreed to our demands of ceding Syrmia and receiving economic reparations. Although less profitable, this course of action was certainly safer."
illyria.29.a:0 "Success!"

illyria.30.t:0 "Illyria refuses our offer"
illyria.30.d:0 "The Illyrians refused our compromisation. What they don't realize is that this will affect them more than it affects us, and worst of all, the Austrians will profit off of this rivalry.  However, we cannot simply denounce our claims, as we'd be seen as too weak by the people."
illyria.30.a:0 "They had their chance."

illyria.31.t:0 "Illyria wants to cut ties with us"
illyria.31.d:0 "How things are going, it certainly seems that the Illyrians are on a path to independence. They're slowly making their efforts official, and one of their steps is to sever their ties with us, officially. As they cannot declare full independence yet, we can try to actively hinder them, while suffering a bit ourselves, or we can just let them go, and solve this issue."
illyria.31.a:0 "Hinder their actions."
illyria.31.b:0 "Let them go."

illyria.32.t:0 "Austrians let us go"
illyria.32.d:0 "It seems that the Austrians have stopped their endeavors in hindering our progress towards independence, and are willing to cut their ties with us without any problems."
illyria.32.a:0 "Things are going good."

illyria.33.t:0 "Austrians wrestle for control"
illyria.33.d:0 "It seems like Austria is still hell-bent on ruling over us. However, our path to independence is secured, and any further attempts by the Austrians to stop us from gaining independence will hurt them more than it would hurt us."
illyria.33.a:0 "They'll fall soon enough."

illyria.34.t:0 "Illyria officially declares independence"
illyria.34.d:0 "Today, a part of our empire officially declared independence. The rest of the world may cheer at their entrance into the world's political stage, but the Austrian people are still bitter about this. If we want them under our control, we have to declare war before it's too late."
illyria.34.a:0 "We can't risk it..."
illyria.34.b:0 "Time for them to succumb!"

illyria.35.t:0 "Austria declares war"
illyria.35.d:0 "Bitter about our declaration of independence, the Habsburg monarchy has declared war on our country. We have to quickly mobilize what we have of our army, and defend our homeland!"
illyria.35.a:0 "Death to the aristocracy, freedom to the people!"

illyria.36.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić dies"
illyria.36.d:0 "Today, it was announced that Stjepan Sarkotić died from natural causes. As it was time for him to pass away because of his old age, Mehmed Spaho took the power of representing Karl I in this country. His unique, realistic approach to the Illyrian identity may prove to be good for this country, along with his respectful attitude towards the Austrians."
illyria.36.a:0 "Good luck Mr. Spaho!"

illyria.37.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić dies"
illyria.37.d:0 "Today, it was announced that Stjepan Sarkotić died from natural causes. As it was time for him to pass away because of his old age, Mehmed Spaho took the power of representing Karl I in Illyria. Since Sarkotić died earlier than we thought, we missed our chance of putting a Habsburg to rule Illyria. However, with Mehmed Spaho's friendly attitude and a unique approach to the Illyrian national identity, we have to be grateful that the position didn't fall to any others."
illyria.37.a:0 "Hopefully he won't do anything stupid."

illyria.38.t:0 "Spaho calls for elections"
illyria.38.d:0 "Today, Mehmed Spaho announced the end of his provisional government, and called for elections. Most of the Illyrians are hit by a wave of euphoria, as they've rushed to vote for their own candidates. There are currently three parties that have a chance of winning - the Democratic Party, headed by Mehmed Spaho himself, who is already famous with Illyrians for bringing them independence; the Illyrian Peasant People's Party, headed by Stjepan Radić, who is popular among Croats, which is evident by his politics that favor the Croat majority; and the People's Socialist Party, headed by Đuro Pucar, which was created as sort of a compromise with the rising Syndicalist factions. This would satisfy the Illyrians that are in favor of unity, but the rest of the Balkans will keep an eye out for us."
illyria.38.a:0 "DS wins the people's favor, again!"
illyria.38.b:0 "IPSS wins by a landslide!"
illyria.38.c:0 "The NSS rises to power!"

illyria.39.t:0 "Illyrian presidential elections"
illyria.39.d:0 "As the Illyrian constituation says, the elections are held every 4 years. The citizens are in euphoria, as they're hoping that their candidate wins. As with before, the possible winners are the Democratic Party; the Illyrian Peasant People's Party; and the People's Socialist Party."
illyria.39.a:0 "DS wins the people's favor!"
illyria.39.b:0 "IPSS wins by a landslide!"
illyria.39.c:0 "The NSS rises to power!"

illyria.40.t:0 "Reforming the education"
illyria.40.d:0 "Ever since Illyria got its independence from Austria, we need to implement an education reform in order to fully break free from Austrian influences. As intellectual movements are getting more and more popular, more value is attributed to the Illyrian education. There are three ways we can reform our education. The first way, mostly supported by Croatians and Montenegrin autonomists, advocates for a 'non-biased' outlook on the situation - Illyrians are different people with different history. The second way, mostly supported by the Bosnians and Illyrian intellectuals, includes focusing more on social science, educating the populace about Illtrian unity and values. The third way advocates for sugarcoating and disregarding certain historical sources, most notably promoting the idea that the Illyrians are the ancestors of all Southern Slavs."
illyria.40.a:0 "A realistic outlook is needed."
illyria.40.b:0 "We shall teach them of Brotherhood and Unity."
illyria.40.c:0 "We are all Illyrians."

illyria.41.t:0 "Local governments resist centralization"
illyria.41.d:0 "Our recent attemts at centralizing the government have been proven quite difficult to achieve. This has caused an uproar in local governments that encompass certain areas. We can continue to centralize our country, which would take some serious effort, or we can just let that idea go and save us the trouble."
illyria.41.a:0 "Proceed with Centralization!"
illyria.41.b:0 "This won't do us any good..."

illyria.42.t:0 "Syrmia defects to Serbia"
illyria.42.d:0 "The region of Syrmia, an area spanning from Vukovar to Zemun, mostly populated by the Serbs, has recently defected to the Serbian state. This doesn't bode well for our country, especially since Vukovar is claimed by us. We cannot declare a war on Serbia under Austrian supervision, so there is seemingly nothing we can do."
illyria.42.a:0 "Damn them!"

illyria.43.t:0 "Syrmia defects to us"
illyria.43.d:0 "The region of Syrmia, an area spanning from Vukovar to Zemun, mostly populated by our people, has recently announced that they're going to be under our rule. The reason they give us is that Croatia is being ruled by a Croatian supremacist, who wishes to transform Illyria into Greater Croatia. Since the region of Syrmia is so small, and Austria forbids the Illyrians on declaring war, the Syrmians can easily defect."
illyria.43.a:0 "Welcome, brothers"

illyria.44.t:0 "Montenegro defects"
illyria.44.d:0 "Recently, the Montenegrin autonomous government has declared independence from Illyria, crowning king Danilo II. They're claiming that Illyria is becoming a more hostile place for non-Croats, citing various times the Croatian government blindly favored Croats over other nationalities. This is an outrage, as Illyria is growing smaller by every minute."
illyria.44.a:0 "We should have predicted this."
illyria.44.b:0 "Glory to King Danilo II! (Play as Montenegro)"

illyria.45.t:0 "Declare war on Montenegro?"
illyria.45.d:0 "Montenegro's declaration of independence shocked the whole nation. Bosnia, or the Serbs in Croatia may soon follow their example, unless we use force and teach them not to. We may also reclaim our lost territory. However, Austria may get angry at us, and the Serbs may even jump in to defend Montenegro."
illyria.45.a:0 "The Austrians would understand. Declare war!"
illyria.45.b:0 "They're too insignificant for this."

illyria.46.t:0 "Protect Montenegro?"
illyria.46.d:0 "Since Illyria has declared war on Montenegro, a fellow Serbian country, we now have the chance of helping our brothers out. We can also grab further territory from them, territories that are populated by the Serbs who found themselved under a Croatian supremacist."
illyria.46.a:0 "Only Unity Saves the Serbs! Help them out!"
illyria.46.b:0 "We've had enough of wars."

illyria.47.t:0 "Chaos in Illyria"
illyria.47.d:0 "Following the inaurugation of a certain Croatian supremacist, the Illyrian country has went into chaos, with both smaller and bigger minority revolts happening, the biggest revolt being Spaho's revolt. A lot of communities have defected, including Syrmia and Montenegro. We have yet to make a decision - we can let them go, let them fight it out and have them under our control later, we can assist the official Illyrian government, or we can directly annex every one of the troublemakers."
illyria.47.a:0 "Let them go."
illyria.47.b:0 "Let them fight it out."
illyria.47.c:0 "Assist Illyria!"
illyria.47.e:0 "Declare war on everyone!"

illyria.48.t:0 "Illyrian nationalists criticize the government"
illyria.48.d:0 "A collective of so-called intellectuals that propagate 'unity' have expressed their concerns against our government. Their critiques included our attitude towards the various minorities that inhabit our country. It doesn't help that the group has a good amount of Croatians, since this is causing an ideological rift inside our population. The only course of action we could take is to exile them from our officially controlled areas."
illyria.48.a:0 "So-called unity has no place in Greater Croatia! Send them away!"

illyria.49.t:0 "Serbia protects Montenegro"
illyria.49.d:0 "Following our declaration of war on Montenegro, the Serbian government has responded with assisting their brothers. As the Illyrian front is stretched, it will be more difficult for us to conquer Montenegro."
illyria.49.a:0 "Troubling."

illyria.50.t:0 "Austria joins the war on our side"
illyria.50.d:0 "Following the chaos that erupted, the Austrians have officially sent us a declaration, where they say that they'll aid us in our fight against the rebels. This is an unexpected move, and it's going surprisingly well."
illyria.50.a:0 "We are glad they understand."

illyria.51.t:0 "Austria declares war on us"
illyria.51.d:0 "Following the chaos that erupted, the Austrians have officially sent us a declaration of war, citing that we've breached many of the rules they've set. Direct annexation will follow if we don't obey them."
illyria.51.a:0 "Illyria is doomed!"

illyria.52.t:0 "Dvorniković's Revolt"
illyria.52.d:0 "Following their exile, several pro-Illyrian intellectual groups have taken refuge in rural parts of Bosnia, constantly evading the authorities. Under the leadership of Vladimir Dvorniković, a Croatian, they have managed to amass enough support to start a huge revolt all over the north and eastern parts of Bosnia, including some more areas. Dvorniković has decided to take the mantle of uniting the southern slavs. As of now, the militias of Bosnia have risen against us and have either overthrown the former local administration, or the administrations themselves have joined their efforts. It's either that Illyria becomes a reality again, or the dream of a greater, pure Croatia will be realized."
illyria.52.a:0 "It will all end soon."
illyria.52.b:0 "Pavelić will not stand! (Play as the Revolt)"

illyria.53.t:0 "Our Army"
illyria.53.d:0 "When the Southern Slavs first formed their militias, it was against several external threats. What they didn't know is that they'd have to form the militias again, this time against their own brothers, who have sadly fallen to extremism. Now it is time for the Southern Slavic people to unite and destroy their common threat - their own nationalism!"
illyria.53.a:0 "Rise my minions!"

illyria.54.t:0 "Serbian Minority revolts"
illyria.54.d:0 "The Serbian minority located in Croatia, mostly in the area of Knin, have risen in the favor of our cause of pacifying our fallen brothers! It is time for us to show them that they're the only ones resisting us!"
illyria.54.a:0 "Excellent!"

illyria.55.t:0 "Pavelić has been captured"
illyria.55.d:0 "Today, our valuable commander Pavelić has been captured by the Illyrian rebels. With the remaining Ustaše faltering and disbanding, Illyrian-friendly administrations have taken control of Illyria. Bitter about Illyria falling into the hands of Croatian nationalists, Dvorniković will rule Illyria, and make sure we don't stray away from the path of unity."
illyria.55.a:0 "Glory to Dvorniković and Illyria!"

illyria.56.t:0 "Dvorniković has been executed"
illyria.56.d:0 "Today, the thorn in our eye, Vladimir Dvorniković, was captured and promply executed by the Ustaše. As the remaining rebels are being scattered around Bosnia, it will take some effort to get rid of them, but for now, Pavelić-friendly administrations can take control of the regions. We have won the civil war."
illyria.56.a:0 "Glory to the Ustaše!"

illyria.57.t:0 "Austria demands Annexation"
illyria.57.d:0 "We have received an official letter from the Habsburgs, which requests us to recognize their direct rule, essentially annexing us. Pratically, we have the full right to refuse, as they haven't assisted us."
illyria.57.a:0 "We cannot risk it."
illyria.57.b:0 "We will not submit!"

illyria.58.t:0 "Illyria refuses annexation"
illyria.58.d:0 "The Illyrian government has responded to our annexation request - they won't submit to us. We only have the option to leave this destabilized region, as we didn't do anything in the civil war to justify a full-on war with them."
illyria.58.a:0 "They're too destabilized anyways."

illyria.59.t:0 "Austria demands Annexation"
illyria.59.d:0 "We have received an official letter from the Habsburgs, which requests us to recognize their direct rule, essentially annexing us. Without their help, we would have probably lost against the rebels, so it would be a great risk to refuse."
illyria.59.a:0 "We cannot risk it."
illyria.59.b:0 "We will not submit!"

illyria.60.t:0 "Illyria refuses annexation"
illyria.60.d:0 "The Illyrian government has responded to our annexation request - they won't submit to us. We have the option to leave this destabilized region, not dealing with any of their problems, or we can declare war on them, since they won the civil war with our help."
illyria.60.a:0 "They're too destabilized anyways."
illyria.60.b:0 "War is the only solution!"

illyria.61.t:0 "Pavelić facing charges"
illyria.61.d:0 "Ever since Pavelić was captured, he is waiting on a trial against his crimes. We can sentence him to a court with an independent courtroom, essentially having views independent from our state, or we can sentence him to a kangaroo court, where we would promote our ideals while denouncing his crimes. Either way, Pavelić will end up imprisoned for life."
illyria.61.a:0 "An independent court, let people know!"
illyria.61.b:0 "A kangaroo court, glory to Illyria!"

illyria.62.t:0 "A Catholic Theocracy?"
illyria.62.d:0 "With our recent focus on favoring Catholics over others, Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac has expressed his satisfaction. Although critical of the Ustaše (but not their quest for a Catholic Croatia), appointing Stepinac would help us with inner unrests, and win us favor with other Catholic countries."
illyria.62.a:0 "God wills it!"
illyria.62.b:0 "We don't have to go this far."

illyria.63.t:0 "Orthodox population Banished"
illyria.63.d:0 "Today, our glorious motherland has started banishing the schismatics that live in rightful Croatian lands. Orthodoxy has always been an enemy of the Croats, and we will make sure that they're defeated. We have also taken the liberty of assassinating some of their religious figureheads, just for precaution."
illyria.63.a:0 "Croatia is for Croats!"

illyria.64.t:0 "New Catholic Convertees"
illyria.64.d:0 "Today, our glorious motherland has received wonderful news. The previously Orthodox populace were completely willingly enlightened by our followers of the one true religion. Following the covert assassinations of their religious figureheads, most of the populace's minds stopped becoming tainted by schismatism, although some got in trouble with the Croatian authorities. Nevertheless, this is a joyful day for Catholicism!"
illyria.64.a:0 "Hallelujah!"

illyria.65.t:0 "A Rightful Croatia?"
illyria.65.d:0 "While Pavelić has proven himself to be a great leader in dire times, we may need someone who can rule over Croatia in times of peace. Pavelić's friend, Aleksandar Horvat, who is also a lawyer, can take the mantle of guiding Croatians in times of peace. This will also help us with our projects of historical revisionism, making it more resistant to outside critiques."
illyria.65.a:0 "Glory to Horvat!"
illyria.65.b:0 "No change is necessary."

illyria.66.t:0 "A Devout Follower"
illyria.66.d:0 "For those who are following political developments in the Balkans, what was once the Triune Kingdom of Illyria, became the Catholic State of Croatia through a huge civil war. With them being devout followers of Catholicism, we could easily make them recognize our rule over them, however not without backlash. We may need this extra help, but at the same time, we shouldn't meddle in Balkan politics."
illyria.66.a:0 "We need all the help we can get."
illyria.66.b:0 "Let them be."

illyria.67.t:0 "Citizens protest the government"
illyria.67.d:0 "This afternoon, the streets of Zagreb were metaphorically blown away by a protest organized by disgruntled citizens. Another wave of protests soon followed throughout all of Illyria's major cities. The protesters call for the resignation of Sarkotić, and advocate for a syndicalist government."
illyria.67.a:0 "Let them cry."

illyria.68.t:0 "Citizens criticize the government"
illyria.68.d:0 "This morning a prominent orator criticized our government. He addressed a number of serious, but true issues about our country. However, they're still contributing to the problem themselves, destabilizing the country. We can seemingly do nothing, since if we used force, we'd risk an open rebellion."
illyria.68.a:0 "Let them cry."

illyria.69.t:0 "Peasants protest the government"
illyria.69.d:0 "Lately, there has been a huge wave of peasant protests, mostly in rural Croatia and Bosnia. Since our country is mostly rural, it would be dumb not to respond to these protests. We can carry out a reform, which would please them to a degree, or we can act tough and consolidate our control over them."
illyria.69.a:0 "Illyria needs her peasants."
illyria.69.b:0 "Who do they think they are?"

illyria.70.t:0 "Threats of Secession"
illyria.70.d:0 "Because of our chaotic, destabilized state, several local administrations, and even some larger ones, have threatened us to secede. These range from the petty so-called 'Republic of Brčko' to larger ones, such as Montenegro (especially the Montenegrin aristocracy), and Herzegovina. We can give them some autonomy, which would satisfy them to a degree, or we can remind them that they're still under us."
illyria.70.a:0 "We will not fall to them!"
illyria.70.b:0 "Grant them autonomy."

illyria.71.t:0 "Assassination of Sarkotić"
illyria.71.d:0 "Today, the chaotic situation in Illyria culminated into a full-on coup by the protestors. Stjepan Sarkotić was assassinated, and before the Illyrian officials could do anything, Pavle Gregorić, a pro-Bolshevik volunteer in the Russian Civil War, took power, while essentially cutting all ties with the Austrian government. As the Socialist Workers' Party now rules Illyria, there is a threat for us to be the targets of other reactionary Balkan countries. Although by force, our dream of a Socialist Illyria has been achieved, and the revolution has been lit in the Balkans."
illyria.71.a:0 "Long live Socialist Illyria!"

illyria.72.t:0 "Georg Dragičević's potential retirement"
illyria.72.d:0 "Ever since Illyria tried to achieve independence, the sudden swing back into definite Austrian rule made things somewhat destabilized. As Georg Dragičević is somewhat unpopular with the common people, we can ask him to retire and give the Habsburgs direct rule over Illyria. We can give the rule to Karl I, who will be known as Karlo IV, or we can reward his son Otto I, since he has taken interest in the Illyrian people. Since Dragičević has no other reason to resign, we can still save ourselves the hassle, and let him rule over Illyria until further notice."
illyria.72.a:0 "Karl I is the new King of Illyria!"
illyria.72.b:0 "Let them be lead by someone who appreciates them."
illyria.72.c:0 "Dragičević stays."

illyria.73.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić dies"
illyria.73.d:0 "Today, it was announced that Stjepan Sarkotić died from natural causes. It was time for him to pass away, since he lived more than anyone would expect. Still, the death of this previous ruler of Illyria reminds us that we can only go forward in time."
illyria.73.a:0 "Memento mori."

illyria.74.t:0 "Mehmed Spaho dies"
illyria.74.d:0 "Today was a sad day for Illyrians, as their prominent figurehead, Mehmed Spaho, was found dead in his home from a heart attack. The people of Illyria are mourning his death, as these sad news are being delivered all around Illyria. Needless to say, the Democratic Party needs a new leader. One of the most popular candidates is Vladimir Nazor, a poet whose ideology is also a little bit mixed with socialism, although not as much for it to be considered Social Democratic. Another one of the popular candidates is Hamdija Karamehmedović, a doctor and a fellow member of Spaho's intellectual group. It is assumed that his politics will be similar to Spaho's. The third most popular candidate, Ivo Andrić, another renowned poet, isn't as popular as the other candidates, although he's more apolitical than the other candidates. Which candidate wins the election?"
illyria.74.a:0 "Vladimir Nazor will lead the party."
illyria.74.b:0 "Dr. Karamehmedović takes control."
illyria.74.c:0 "Ivo Andrić becomes the leader."

#illyria.75.t:0 "Mehmed Spaho dies"
#illyria.75.d:0 "Mehmed is dead, Vladimir Dvorniković takes control."
#illyria.75.a:0 "Dvorniković will bring us unity!"

illyria.75.t:0 "Status of Croatian Muslims"
illyria.75.d:0 "Since we are technically a Catholic nation, we have to address Croatian Muslims and what to do with them. Pavelić himself advocates for a diplomatic solution - they're still Croats, and Islam taught them to fight for themselves against the Orthodox oppressors, while others advocate for us to turn them back to their original religion of Catholicism. What should we do?"
illyria.75.a:0 "They're still Croats."
illyria.75.b:0 "They don't get a pass!"

illyria.76.t:0 "The Socialist Convention - Day 1"
illyria.76.d:0 "Ever since Pavle Gregorić, a member of the Socialist Workers' Party, took control over Illyria, several prominent members of the Socialist Workers' Party have discussed starting an official convention, and deciding on socialist reforms, as well as deciding on a leader. The issues of the first day include the industrial reform, as Illyria needs to keep up to date with other countries in terms of industry, although without stressing itself too much. The Syndicalist wing, with the renowned Josip Broz Tito in charge of it, advocates for a balanced industrialization - essentially mixing collectivisation and nationalization, whith the state also having a role in developing new factories. The Totalist wing, headed by Pavle Gregorić himself, advocate for full nationalization, since the government needs the industry in order not to fall into the hands of Austrians or anyone else. The Radical Socialist wing, which is also the main wing of the party, advocates for full collectivisation with agrarian elements, in order to fulfill the potential of Illyria's untapped agricultural industry."
illyria.76.a:0 "We need the best of both worlds."
illyria.76.b:0 "We need every help we can get."
illyria.76.c:0 "We should keep true to socialism."

illyria.77.t:0 "The Socialist Convention - Day 2"
illyria.77.d:0 "Since the first debate about the industrialization, which happened several days ago, we now need to address the elephant in the room - the Illyrian national identity, and how to enforce it to our people. With the Croatians gladly accepting the identity, we need to approach the minorities about this new identity. The Syndicalist wing advocates for a smooth conversion - first they're Illyrian by nationality, then we'll need to merge the Southern Slavic identities, particularly the Serbo-Croatian speaking ones, to the Illyrian identity. As for now, the Syndicalists say that we should treat the minorities the same as the majority. The Totalist however, advocate for a policy they call 'Illyrification', which would enforce the Illyrian national identity upon the rebellious, while also renaming everything Serbo-Croatian to 'Illyrian' and so on. With this philosophy, the only minorities are the Germans and Hungarians. The socialists, however, provide a different, out of the box approach to the situation. They claim that we don't need to enforce the identity, and because Illyria is a country united by an ideology, not an ethnicity, it means that ethnicity should not be an issue."
illyria.77.a:0 "We will treat them as any others."
illyria.77.b:0 "What minorities? We are all Illyrian!"
illyria.77.c:0 "Our differences can still coexist."

illyria.78.t:0 "The Socialist Convention - Day 3"
illyria.78.d:0 "As the Socialist conventions come to a close, there is still one issue at hand, which is the Religion - a dividing factor in the Balkans since the Christian Schism. As both Islam, Catholicism and Orthodoxy are still strong, this issue needs to be addressed. The Syndicalist advocate for the freedom of religion, although there should be a clear separation of the Church and the State, and also seek to separate Religion and Nationalism even further. The Totalist advocate for a radical approach - that Illyria should enforce state atheism, and should get rid of the biggest diving factor in the Balkans, religion. The Radical Socialists, however, think that it's best to slowly root out religious thoughts, by banning religious magazines, while still technically allowing the freedom of religion."
illyria.78.a:0 "We need a compromise."
illyria.78.b:0 "The Church will not divide us!"
illyria.78.c:0 "We should do it slowly, and smoothly."

illyria.79.t:0 "End of The Socialist Convention"
illyria.79.d:0 "As the issues were dealt with and discussed thoroughly, it is now the time to officially choose a leader for Illyria. As both three branches of the party are decently popular, it wouldn't matter much for the people who wins. The first candidate is Josip Broz Tito, a former locksmith who shows great promise to lead Illyria. He represents the Syndicalist wing. The second candidate is Pavle Gregorić himself, who promises to wipe the shame off of Russian-styled Bolshevism, at least in the Balkans. He represents the Totalist wing. The third candidate is, technically, a collective of Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and other socialist thinkers from all around Illyria, who think that one person representing Illyria would be harmful to the country's stability. They also advocate for an internationale-friendly foreign policy. They represent the Socialist wing pf the party. All three candidates have a nearly equal chance of winning, and the people follow the elections with anticipation."
illyria.79.a:0 "Josip Broz Tito will not lead us astray!"
illyria.79.b:0 "Gregorić will bring Illyria glory!"
illyria.79.c:0 "The Socialist Council will bring us stability!"

illyria.80.t:0 "Revolution in Illyria"
illyria.80.d:0 "This afternoon, we have received the news that Stjepan Sarkotić was assassinated by the rebellious people of Illyria, who placed Pavle Gregorić, a former pro-Bolshevik volunteer, as the head of state. We have also received reports that Illyria has declared its independence from us. We can react to this travesty by declaring war and having our direct control over their populace. What should we do?"
illyria.80.a:0 "We should let it go."
illyria.80.b:0 "We will extinguish the flames of the revolution!"

illyria.81.t:0 "Austria declares war on us"
illyria.81.d:0 "Today, the Austrian military unlawfully crossed our borders. This means that they intend to militarily occupy this bastion of the revolution until our support for it dies down. We can try fighting them ourselves, but we can also try to contact the French and negotiate a deal. The deal will most likely include them placing an International-friendly government after the socialist convention. They may prove to be a huge help to us."
illyria.81.a:0 "We should seek help."
illyria.81.b:0 "We will destroy them ourselves!"

illyria.82.t:0 "Illyria requests our help"
illyria.82.d:0 "A nation on the Balkans, encompassing a huge group of South Slavs, has recently embraced the revolution. However, they seem to be in trouble, with the Austrians declaring war on them, in hopes of occupying them. The Illyrians have came to our aid, and our diplomats are discussing the best compromise we can make. If we agree to help, then the Illyrians will be guaranteed to have an International-friendly leader, with them immediately joining us. We can also refuse, since a war with a European superpower would overstretch us. However, we can also bargain in our favor, with the Illyrians having to place a French-friendly government, which would recognize us over them."
illyria.82.a:0 "We will not let our comrades down!"
illyria.82.b:0 "They're sadly on their own."
illyria.82.c:0 "We need control in the Balkans!"

illyria.83.t:0 "The French will help us"
illyria.83.d:0 "We have received good news from our French comrades. They have agreed to help us, in exchange for us setting up an International-friendly government after the Socialist Convention. The relations between the French and the Illyrians are reignited!"
illyria.83.a:0 "Hooray!"

illyria.84.t:0 "The French refuse"
illyria.84.d:0 "We have received bad news from the French diplomats. They have refused to help us in our struggle against the Austrians. Nevertheless, we can't blame them for this, since they have enough issues at their own, namely Germany, the hegemon of Europe itself."
illyria.84.a:0 "Bummer."

illyria.85.t:0 "End of The Socialist Convention"
illyria.85.d:0 "As the issues were dealt with and discussed thoroughly, it is now the time to officially place the French-friendly Socialist thinkers as the head of Illyria. Their actions will be monitored by the Internationale, while we will enjoy a secure, stable membership. However, we can also betray them by choosing a more independent leader, such as Gregorić or Tito, although we will risk a war with them. What can we do?"
illyria.85.a:0 "Long live the Third International!"
illyria.85.b:0 "Betray the French, Gregorić will lead us!"
illyria.85.c:0 "Betray the French, Tito will lead us!"

illyria.86.t:0 "Illyria betrays the Revolution"
illyria.86.d:0 "Despite our deal, the Illyrian government has put [ILL.GetLeader] as its leader. Even after dragging us into such a chaotic state, we need to decide what we should do with them. Some call out for a war, while others advocate for peace negotiations with Austria. Some even call for us to let Illyria go, as their place in the Balkans will nevertheless spread Socialism. What shall we do?"
illyria.86.a:0 "War on Illyria AND Austria!"
illyria.86.b:0 "Let the Illyrians through the cracks."
illyria.86.c:0 "Negotiate peace with Austria."

illyria.87.t:0 "The French negotiate peace"
illyria.87.d:0 "Following their failure in this campaign, the French are willing to negotiate peace with us. With both of our countries torn by war, we can either request reparations, pure white peace, or continue with the war. What shall we do?"
illyria.87.a:0 "We need reparations!"
illyria.87.b:0 "White peace is for the best."
illyria.87.c:0 "No deals with the devil!"

illyria.88.t:0 "Forming Autonomous Regions"
illyria.88.d:0 "Over the days, our administration has discussed about forming autonomous regions in Croatia. We have planned to make two autonomous regions in Croatia - the first one being the Autonomous Region of Slavonia, and the other being the Autonomous Region of Dalmatia, both areas being a cultural melting pot. Shall we execute this idea?"
illyria.88.a:0 "This is genius."
illyria.88.b:0 "This is a bad idea."

illyria.89.t:0 "Illyria in the [Root.GetFactionName]?"
illyria.89.d:0 "Today, the Illyrian government has expressed their wish to cooperate with us, as well as in our future endeavors, by letting them join the [Root.GetFactionName]. We have the full right to refuse their request."
illyria.89.a:0 "We welcome our Illyrian brothers."
illyria.89.b:0 "They are not needed."

illyria.90.t:0 "Illyria gains independence"
illyria.90.d:0 "The Republic of Illyria, which is mainly composed of the former territories of Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro, has officially succeeded in declaring independence against the Austrians. Thanks to the excellent leadership of President Mehmed Spaho, the Illyrians have been freed from the Austrians without any major difficulties. /nWithout any higher-ups ordering Illyria, it will be interesting to see how the Illyrians handle their newfound indpendence."
illyria.90.a:0 "Will this country stand? Only time will tell."
illyria.90.b:0 "It is a fair loss, but a loss nonetheless."

illyria.91.t:0 "Illyrian Civil War"
illyria.91.d:0 "Recently, the Illyrian state has been plunged into chaos, following the retirement of Stjepan Sarkotić and the placement of Ante Pavelić, a well-known Croatian ultranationalist, as the leader of Illyria. After banishing a few prominent pan-slavic thinkers, a revolt has risen in northeastern Bosnia, headed by Vladimir Dvorniković, one of the exiled. Even the Kingdom of Montenegro has seceded from the Croatian ultranationalist state. Austrian administration has reportedly evacuated in order to steer clear from the chaos that ensured. /nOnly time will tell who will emerge victorious - the unpopular, but powerful Croatian nationalists; or the numerous, but disorganized rebels."
illyria.91.a:0 "Balkans, nationalism and wars. Nothing new."
illyria.91.b:0 "The situation is dire, indeed."

illyria.92.t:0 "Illyria becomes Greater Croatia"
illyria.92.d:0 "Following the defeat of the Illyrian revolt, Ante Pavelić has declared Illyria's official transformation into a Greater Croatian state. Becoming an advocate for Croatian 'Purity' and hostility towards the Orthodox minorities, Pavelić's state would be considered a dictatorship by any means. Only time will tell if other Balkan nations will bother with them. Looks like the mantle of Slavic unity was too heavy for the Illyrians."
illyria.92.a:0 "One does not simply unite the Slavs."

illyria.93.t:0 "Croatian Ultranationalists Defeated"
illyria.93.d:0 "Following the rise of the Illyrian revolt, the Illyrian revolt has announced their victory and capture of Ante Pavelić, the leader of his self-proclaimed state of Greater Croatia. Vladimir Dvorniković, the leader of the revolt, has taken control of Illyria, and is seemingly hellbent on quenching any other nationalists that may rise. Nevertheless, the Illyrian unity prevailed even against its biggst enemy, and it seems that the disunified state will finally be in peace."
illyria.93.a:0 "It's a miracle on the Balkans!"

illyria.94.t:0 "Stjepan Sarkotić assassinated"
illyria.94.d:0 "As Ilyria was experiencing a huge wave of protests up to this point, the numerous, pro-socialist workers' rebellions eventually culminated into the assassination of Stjepan Sarkotić, the leader of Illyria. As the Austrian officials were away, the Illyrian populace has put Pavle Gregorić, a former Bolshevik volunteer, as the head of state and declared independence. Only time will tell if a socialist country in the Balkans is viable."
illyria.94.a:0 "A revolution? In the Balkans?"

illyria.95.t:0 "Black Monday hits Illyria"
illyria.95.d:0 "As a country under Austria, the Illyrian economy also suffered a huge loss after the Black Monday. With the Illyrian industry being focused on unrefined goods, we're forced to make unfavorable deals with the Austrians and Germans, and as a country with absolutely no say in this type of trading, this means that our economy suffers greatly. As our Serbian neighbours to the east are blissfully watching us in peace, we should try to implement several reformations and immediate actions in order for our economy to start recovering."
illyria.95.a:0 "God help us!"

illyria.96.t:0 "Illyria wants to trade"
illyria.96.d:0 "Due to the Black Monday crash, the Kingdom of Illyria is being forced to make unfavorable trades with their raw resources, by the orders of Austria and Germany. However, things recently took a turn for the better as soon as they introduced tariffs, defying the Austrian orders. However, they have also offered us a trade deal, as our economy was untouched by the Black Monday. We're in no position to refuse, although this will give us favorable deals anyways - both in raw and refined resources."
illyria.96.a:0 "They're finally growing a spine."

illyria.97.t:0 "Local Administrations raise forces"
illyria.97.d:0 "With Illyia being threatened by war, the forces of several local administrations have risen to defend our cities from the enemy. Although somewhat insignificant, the garrisons will certainly help us defend against the enemy."
illyria.97.a:0 "For Glory!"

illyria.98.t:0 "A Familiar Face"
illyria.98.d:0 "Following the Illyrian rebellions, a Canadian man by the name of Spiridon Mekas has arrived in our country and requested to see the Gregorić administration. Seeming fishy, our soldiers made sure that he wasn't carrying any concealed weapons, nor had any intent to assassinate Gregorić or do anything else. After getting in touch with Gregorić, it was revealed that he was a socialist that was exiled from Austria, by the name of Josip Broz Tito. Gregorić and Tito exchanged a lengthy discussion, covering topics such as the current state of Illyria, and how to move up in the world. Nevertheless, with the revolution succeeding in Illyria, Mr. Broz can finally continue with his political career."
illyria.98.a:0 "Welcome back, Comrade Tito."

illyria.99.t:0 "The Slovenian Question"
illyria.99.d:0 "The Slavic, Slovenian people have been ruled over by us for quite a long time. Recent developments have strengthened their national identity, which hindered our attempts to integrate them. Capitalizing on this, the Illyrians asked us to concede Slovenia to them. We can agree, and focus our efforts elsewhere, or we can keep Slovenia to ourselves."
illyria.99.a:0 "We'll be better off without them."
illyria.99.b:0 "Let them cry!"

illyria.100.t:0 "Austrians agree to our demands"
illyria.100.d:0 "Not wanting to suffer a risk of Slovenian nationalist revival, the Austrians caved in to our demands, in exchange for us recognizing their territorial integrity, at least for now. Our Slovenian brothers have officially joined us!"
illyria.100.a:0 "Welcome, fellow Illyrians!"

illyria.101.t:0 "Austrians refuse our demands"
illyria.101.d:0 "Not being bothered by a Slovenian Nationalist Revival, the Austrians have declined our request to integrate Slovenia in our country. This has hurt our country's reputation, and our people are somewhat demoralized."
illyria.101.a:0 "We'll get them later."

illyria.102.t:0 "The Serbian Issue"
illyria.102.d:0 "East of us is another South Slavic country with huge ambitions, Serbia. With our shaky relations, we need to address their issue, and what we should do with them. Some recommend that we organize a peaceful unification proposal, as they're also Illyrians no less than us. However, this could also mean that we would make some compromises in order to unite these countries. This would also mean that we'll grab the torch of leading the Belgrade Pact. Other, more militant people, suggest that we outright conquer them, as their mere existance and ambitions are a threat to the Illyrian people, and integrate them later. However, some people also suggest that we leave them alone, as our country isn't stable enough to support such a huge influx of Serbs, which would mean that the Serbs themselves will become a majority."
illyria.102.a:0 "Organize a proposition."
illyria.102.b:0 "Conquer them!"
illyria.102.c:0 "Leave them alone, for now."

illyria.103.t:0 "Illyria asks for unification"
illyria.103.d:0 "Our neighbours to the west, the Illyrians, have organized several talks, in the goal of unifying our nations. They tell us that we're weak on our own, and ask us for a peaceful unification, where we'll share common goals, and that we'll be treated as one of their own. They have also given us another option, if we don't find the previous proposition appealing enough, we could instead be steadily integrated, with them conceding us several territories with a Serbian majority, and giving us the status of an autonomous region. We can also refuse this deal altogether, however that may prompt the Illyrians to take action."
illyria.103.a:0 "Let us unite peacefully."
illyria.103.b:0 "They should compromises."
illyria.103.c:0 "We will not cave in!"

illyria.104.t:0 "Serbia agrees to our proposal"
illyria.104.d:0 "The Serbian Government has decided that it would be for the best if our countries united peacefully, as we both share a common goal. We will continue to work towards achieving common goals, for the good of the Souther Slavic, Illyrian people."
illyria.104.a:0 "Brotherhood and Unity prevails!"

illyria.105.t:0 "Serbia agrees to our proposal"
illyria.105.d:0 "The Serbian Government has decided to accept our proposal, although not without compromises. They're to be included as an autonomous region, and receive most territories with a Serbian majority, such as Syrmia. Looks like these kinds of sacrifices are necessary."
illyria.105.a:0 "To make omelette you neeed to break eggs."

illyria.106.t:0 "Serbia diosagrees to our proposal"
illyria.106.d:0 "The Serbian Government has responded to our proposition, albeit in a hostile way. In short, the Serbs won't unite with Illyria for a variety of reasons. Our claims of the Serbian land still stand, but some people recommend us to declare war on them. What shall we do?"
illyria.106.a:0 "They had their chance."
illyria.106.b:0 "Leave them, for now."

illyria.107.t:0 "Approaching Albania"
illyria.107.d:0 "Southwards, there is a small nation by the name of Albania that also claims Illyrian heritage, but is vastly different to us. We should some take action. Some argue that the Illyrian theory also encompasses the Albanians, who weren't slavicized, and therefore makes the Albanians also Illyrians. We can offer them to join our country and maybe grant them autonomy, declare war on them and their pretentious claims, or just leave them alone."
illyria.107.a:0 "Start the negotiations!"
illyria.107.b:0 "They will bow to us!"
illyria.107.c:0 "They're not important."

illyria.108.t:0 "Illyria invites us into the federation"
illyria.108.d:0 "Our northern neighbours, the Illyrians, have invited us into their federation. Despite us both claiming to be Illyrians, we're still vastly different. However, some of their people advocate that we weren't slavicized, and therefore should join our fellow Illyrians. We also have the option of requesting an autonomous status, due to our unique language and history. We can, also, refuse this laughable deal altogether. What should we do?"
illyria.108.a:0 "We're weak by ourselves."
illyria.108.b:0 "Would be best if we had autonomy."
illyria.108.c:0 "This offer is laughable. Ha ha ha!"

illyria.109.t:0 "Albania joins us"
illyria.109.d:0 "We have received good news today. The Albanian people have decided on joining our glorious federation. Today is a great day for everyone!"
illyria.109.a:0 "Long live the Illyrians!"

illyria.110.t:0 "Albania refuses"
illyria.110.d:0 "The Albanians have refused our generous deal. It's clear that they won't have any protection otherwise. Shall we attack them, or leave them alone in their misery?"
illyria.110.a:0 "Conquer them!"
illyria.110.b:0 "We can't be bothered."

illyria.111.t:0 "Flag Referendum"
illyria.111.d:0 "As we have united most of the Balkans under our banned, it is now the time for us to choose a new flag that would fairly represent the other ethnicities under us. A popular candidate is a black-white-red flag, based on Rigas Feraios' design, although with socialist symbols. The black stands for death in the struggle for liberty, the white for the righteousness in the fight against tyranny, and red for the imperial purple. The second most popular candidate is a unique, sleek-looking flag comprised of a red and light blue bicolor, with stars representing the Balkan nations on the top left corner. However, we can also leave our flag unchanged."
illyria.111.a:0 "Black, white and red! For the Balkans!"
illyria.111.b:0 "We want a unique look! The Balkans will prevail!"
illyria.111.c:0 "We've had enough of a change as it is."

illyria.112.t:0 "Illyria in the Belgrade Pact?"
illyria.112.d:0 "Today, in a surprising diplomatic move, the nation of Illyria has decided to apply for membership in the Belgrade Pact. After giving us Montenegro, it would be sort of fair to truly recognize their territorial integrity, and let them join our struggle against the Austrians."
illyria.112.a:0 "Welcome, Slavic brothers."
illyria.112.b:0 "They knew we'd refuse, right?"

illyria.113.t:0 "[ILL.GetName] in Mitteleuropa?"
illyria.113.d:0 "Today, while negotiating with our government, the [ILL.GetAdjective] representatives showed significant interest in joining Mitteleuropa. Having such an ally could help us in the struggle against our enemies, as well as in asserting dominance over the Balkans. However, we may anger the Austrians. What should we do?"
illyria.113.a:0 "Welcome to the world's greatest alliance."
illyria.113.b:0 "We cannot anger the Austrians."

illyria.114.t:0 "Illyria in our sphere again?"
illyria.114.d:0 "Today, in a surprising diplomatic move, the nation of Illyria has decided to express interest in rejoining our sphere of influence. Looks like they can't last a moment without us."
illyria.114.a:0 "Welcome back!"
illyria.114.b:0 "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

illyria.115.t:0 "[ILL.GetName] in the Mediteranean Block?"
illyria.115.d:0 "Today, while negotiating with our government, the [ILL.GetAdjective] representatives showed significant interest in joining the Mediteranean Block. Having such an ally could help us in the struggle against our enemies, as well as in asserting dominance over the Balkans. What should we do?"
illyria.115.a:0 "Welcome, brothers."
illyria.115.b:0 "We cannot let them in."

illyria.118.t:0 "Failure in the Illyrian war of Independence"
illyria.118.d:0 "Following the Illyrian declaraction of independence, we have found ourselves fighting againt the whole Third International, as well as France. In order for our country to stay strong, we need to negotiate peace with The French, and let this petty, ruined country go."
illyria.118.a:0 "Let's negotiate peace."
illyria.118.b:0 "We will never recognize Illyria!"

illyria.119.t:0 "The Austrians negotiate peace"
illyria.119.d:0 "Following their failure in this campaign, the Austrians are willing to negotiate peace with us. With both of our countries torn by war, we can either request reparations both for us and Illyria, pure white peace, or continue with the war. What shall we do?"
illyria.119.a:0 "We need reparations!"
illyria.119.b:0 "White peace is for the best."
illyria.119.c:0 "No mercy to the kraut!"
illyria.119.e:0 "They should be weaker - Cede Slovenia."

illyria.120.t:0 "Failure in the Illyrian war of Independence"
illyria.120.d:0 "Following the Illyrian declaraction of independence, we have found ourselves fighting againt the whole Austrian Sphere. In order for our country to stay strong, we need to negotiate peace with The Austrians, and let this petty, ruined country go."
