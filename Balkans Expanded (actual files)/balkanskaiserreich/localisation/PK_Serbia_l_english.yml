### Event text ###
serbia.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.1.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time however the government has become increasingly anti-Austrian and jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attentions southwards, towards the lands occupied by Bulgaria. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nCan Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"

serbia.31.d:0 "We have successfully planned out our acquisitions of several factories, and we're really close to achieving that plan.

serbia.31.a:0 "Let's do it for the people."
serbia.31.b:0 "We need to defend ourselves."

serbia.32.t:0 "Nationalist Gathering"
serbia.32.d:0 "Local governments report seeing groups of people in Weltkrieg clothing gathering in obscure locations, reportedly speaking about how 'Serbs should rule Serbia' and that 'Austrians are no more than catholic imperialists'. They also touched the topics of religion, and how 'Serbs are God's chosen people'. While we don't necessarily disagree with these statements, they seem to be anti-government oriented. What should we do?"
serbia.32.a:0 "Forbidding them to speak would only prove them right."
serbia.32.b:0 "Serbia must save herself from her own people."

serbia.33.t:0 "Socialist Rally"
serbia.33.d:0 "This morning, tons of citizens were woken up by angry socialist protestors. It's clear that they have very little faith in the government, and advocate for the country to be ruled by its people. However, the most heartbreaking thing was seeing a couple of Weltkrieg veterans protesting along with the youth. Sometimes, it seems they're advocating for a... rather violent solution to this problem. What should we do?"
serbia.33.a:0 "We have more important matters at hand."
serbia.33.b:0 "Get the nightstick, we'll teach them a lesson!"

serbia.34.t:0 "A workers' syndicate is formed!"

It is rumored that they're advocating for better work conditions, but there are also reports of them sprouting anti-establishment slogans. There may be more 'workers' syndicates' forming as we speak. What should we do?"
serbia.34.a:0 "We need every man we can get - leave them alone!"
serbia.34.b:0 "Crack down on these syndicates!"

serbia.35.t:0 "A 'totalist' militia is formed!"
serbia.35.d:0 "People taking refuge in extreme ideologies during times of ire is nothing new for us. However, people reported seeing militias forming in remote communities, who are very similar to an obscure Russian ideology. No conflicts with the government have been made yet, but there's the looming possibility of something dire happening. What should we do?"
serbia.35.a:0 "I'm sure those are just fairytales."
serbia.35.b:0 "Send the search forces immediately!"

serbia.36.t:0 "Local politician claiming 'he can do better'"
serbia.36.d:0 "A local Weltkrieg veteran and politician claimed that he can 'do better than the government itself'. His preaching was initially dismissed as crazy talk - however, some people have actually started following his ideas. Over time, he's growing increasingly 'independent' and hostile. What should we do?"
serbia.36.a:0 "Let the fool preach."
serbia.36.b:0 "He's a threat to the country's stability - liquidate him!"

serbia.37.t:0 "Military coup d'etat!"
serbia.37.d:0 "It seemed that today was one of the ordinary, chaotic days for Petar Bojovic, until a military division stepped into his room. By gunpoint, he was forced to resign and give up his position. Draža's royalists are outraged, and as he heard the news, general Draža resigned!

serbia.38.d:0 "Even though nationalistic ideas are popular with Serbs, there is still a large Albanian population in Kosovo that's not conscripted, nor consider themselves Serbian. We have decided in taking a diplomatic approach to the situation, and we narrowed it down to two options - we can make amends with the Albanian government, recignizing their territorial integrity and offering them protection, in exchange for our Albanian population to be happy; or we can assure them, without the help of the Albanian government, that they're no less Serbian than the ethnic Serbs."

serbia.38.b:0 "The Albanian government should have no part in this."

serbia.39.t:0 "Serbia offers a compromise"
serbia.39.d:0 "With a huge Albanian diaspora that is growing larger every second, Serbia suddenly offered us a deal - if we reassure the Kosovar Albanians that we don't have any hostilities with Serbia, then Serbia will guarantee our territorial integrity. Furthermore, this will help Kosovar Albanians integrate, and in turn render our future covert actions moot. How should we respond?"
serbia.39.a:0 "It's time to rekindle this friendship."
serbia.39.b:0 "What are they thinking? We'll not bend to them!"

serbia.40.t:0 "The treaty is a success!"

serbia.40.a:0 "You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours."

serbia.41.t:0 "Albanian government refuses!"
serbia.41.d:0 "The Albanian government has refused our deal! Our ambitions of compromising with the Albanian populace are complicated even further! Besides, if we declare war, it will only exhaust our population. What can we do?"
serbia.41.a:0 "Reassure them regardless."
serbia.41.b:0 "Nothing we can do."

serbia.42.t:0 "Serbia's declaration of friendship"
serbia.42.d:0 "In the Balkans, a small country known as Serbia, which started the Weltkrieg, was always oriented towards us. Today, they made an official declaration of friendship, but as of now, they're too weak to do anything significant. How should we respond?"

serbia.46.d:0 "It seemed that today was one of the ordinary, chaotic days for Petar Bojovic, until his office was swarmed by syndicalist militiamen. After reportedly killing two of them, he was killed by a gunshot through the head. The two most prominent royalist generals, Draža Mihailović and Milan Nedić were fired.

serbia.47.t:0 "Socialist Workers' Party election!"
serbia.47.d:0 "As we have successfully taken control of Serbia and implemented a socialist economic system, there's much more things that we need to implement. However, there is a huge rift within our party's wings, rendering most reforms we try to pass moot. Therefore, we have decided to make an election within our party, and who will lead us. Vlada Zečević, a former priest, is the socialist candidate who has the highest chance of winning. Electing him as the leader and Chairman of Serbia will calm down our conservative populace. Rade Končar is another candidate, who advocates for an orthodox syndicalist government. It will help that he's seen as a hero of the people. And lastly, we have Aleksandar Ranković, a member of the totalist wing, whose unique philosophies advocates for a centralized government. His policies might prove to be more beneficial than they sound. Which wing shall win?"

There are several options we can take, but one thing is for sure - our people would be upset if we don't put a stop on the Serbian aggression in Kosovo!"
serbia.48.a:0 "This calls for war!"
serbia.48.b:0 "Do nothing, welcome the refugees."

serbia.49.t:0 "Serbia calls for our aid"
serbia.49.d:0 "Today, a small country in the Balkans, known as Serbia, requested our aid in its endeavors. It wouldn't cost much for us to help them, although it may upset our populace, since Serbia started the Weltkrieg. By sending them aid, we'll play a part in spreading socialism through the Balkans, and by denying their aid, we'll let our populace know that we place France first and foremost. What should we do?"
serbia.49.a:0 "Send them help."
serbia.49.b:0 "They're of no use to us."

serbia.50.t:0 "The French send help!"

serbia.50.a:0 "Long live Socialism and Syndicalism!"

serbia.51.t:0 "No replies from France"
serbia.51.d:0 "It seems that France is taking forever to reply to our request, and by each passing hour, it seems that they're ignoring our call for aid. This has left our people somewhat devastated. However, we can try to encourage them to work extra hard for a month, or we can just keep silent. What can we do?"

serbia.72.d:0 "This mod, as you probably know, adds focus trees, events and more to Serbia, Hungary and Illyria (in Serbia's case, upgrading). While our end goal is to give the Balkan nations more paths they can take, I've only managed to convert the old version to the new version, without the Albanian tree.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Where is Albania?/nA: Since Kaiserreich has given Albania an expansive focus tree, I'll make a separate mod which will restore my version of Albania's focus tree, and potentially be integrated into the Balkans Upgraded mod. Might happen after the Hungary update./nQ: Where is Greece?/nA: I haven't started planning the Greek tree yet, since I thought it would be included in the next KR update.
